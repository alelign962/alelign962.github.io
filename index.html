                <h3>Predict Housing Price in Ames Using Python</h3>
                <p>Objective: Predict housing price in log scale. Build two models: 1) Linear regression with Lasso
                    or Ridge. 2) Tree models like random Forest or boosting tree. Utilize Lasso Regression and
                    XGBoost algorithms. Assess model performance on diverse datasets for robust predictive
                    capabilities. Outcome: Identify efficient preprocessing techniques and model configurations
                    to enhance accuracy of real-world house price predictions.</p>
